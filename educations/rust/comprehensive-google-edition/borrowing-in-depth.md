# String
A `[String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html)` is a type that does not implement the `Copy` trait.
Meaning this won't work:
```rust
fn main() {  
    let name = String::from("Rust");  
    do_something(name);  
    println!("{}", name);  
}  
  
fn do_something(name: String) {  
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);  
}
```
This is because we are trying to use (borrow, in the case of `println!`) the value `name` which has already been moved into `do_something` in Line 3.

You cannot use a value that has been moved. Before `name` can even reach `println!`, it was moved into `do_something` and went _out of scope_ at the end of the function.
We can fix this in 2 ways:
`cloning` (it costs):
```rust
fn main() {  
    let name = String::from("Rust");  
    let name_clone = name.clone();  
  
    do_something(name);  
    println!("{}", name_clone);  
}  
  
fn do_something(name: String) {  
    println!("Name: {}!", name);  
}
```
`references`
```rust
fn main() {  
    let name = String::from("Rust");  
    do_something(&name);  
    println!("{}", name);  
}  
  
fn do_something(name: &str) {  
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);  
}
```

# i32
Life is much easier for types that implement the `Copy` trait, like `[i32](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html)`.
So this works:
```rust
fn main() {  
    let age: i32 = 25;  
    do_something(age);  
	println!("{}", age);  
}  
  
fn do_something(age: i32) {  
    println!("Hello, {}!", age);  
}
```

# Struct with String field
A type can implement `Copy` if all of its components implement `Copy` (see [When can my type be](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html#when-can-my-type-be-copy) [Copy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html#when-can-my-type-be-copy)[?](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html#when-can-my-type-be-copy)).
In these listings, we are concerned with the `Movie` struct which consists of one `String` field which _doesnâ€™t_ implement `Copy`. As a result, `Movie` _cannot_ implement `Copy`.
This won't work:
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Movie {
    title: String,
}

fn main() {
    let movie = Movie { 
        title: String::from("Rust")
    };
    do_something(movie);
    println!("Movie: {:?}", movie);
}

fn do_something(movie: Movie) {
    println!("Movie: {:?}!", movie);
}
```
We can fix that by:
`cloning` (it costs):
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]  
struct Movie {  
    title: String,  
}  
  
fn main() {  
    let movie = Movie {   
        title: String::from("Rust")  
    };  
    do_something(movie.clone());  
    println!("Movie: {:?}", movie);  
}  
  
fn do_something(movie: Movie) {  
    println!("Movie: {:?}!", movie);  
}
```
`borrowing`
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]  
struct Movie {  
    title: String,  
}  
  
fn main() {  
    let movie = Movie {   
        title: String::from("Rust")  
    };  
    do_something(&movie);  
    println!("Movie: {:?}", movie);  
}  
  
fn do_something(movie: &Movie) {  
    println!("Movie: {:?}!", movie);  
}
```

# Vec  type String
Like `String`, [Vec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#) are moved, because they donâ€™t implement the `Copy` trait (see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#trait-implementations)). The same move semantics apply.

Vectors (and other collections for that matter) are worth talking about because there are so many semantics involved â€” the container itself, the elements, and the iterators.

We use `Vec` as an example here because itâ€™s a very common data structure for collections. Other collections that also donâ€™t implement the `Copy` trait include `HashMap` and `HashSet`. Move semantics for arrays, on the other hand, work similarly as structs in that they depend on the type of the item â€” but thatâ€™s for another day.

```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
        String::from("John"),  
        String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    do_something(names);  
    println!("{:?}", names);  
}  
  
fn do_something(names: Vec<String>) {  
    println!("{:?}", names);  
}
```
We can fix by:
`borrowing`:
```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    do_something(&names);  
    println!("{:?}", names);  
}  
  
fn do_something(names: &[String]) {  
    println!("{:?}", names);  
}
```
`cloneing` (Note that a vector can be cloned if its underlying type implements the `Clone` trait.):
```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
  ];  
    do_something(names.clone());  
    println!("{:?}", names);  
}  
  
fn do_something(names: Vec<String>) {  
    println!("{:?}", names);  
}
```

Can we move only one element of the `Vec`, NOPE, this won't work:
```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    let name: String = names[0];  
    println!("Hello, {}", name);  
}
```

But why?

See, if you move only one element out of a `Vec`, you leave the vector in an **invalid state** â€” the vector is not a collection of homogenous elements anymore

Implicitly moving out of a `Vec` is not allowed as it would **leave the vector in an invalid state** â€” one element is moved out, the others are not (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27904864/what-does-cannot-move-out-of-index-of-mean) StackOverflow post). If I were to iterate this vector, I might access an invalid memory (the element that was moved out) ðŸ˜±. Thanks for protecting us, Rust.

So what do we do?
We can borrow the value that we want by using the indexing operator.
```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    let name: &str = &names[0];  
    println!("Hello, {}", name);  
}
```

We can also borrow the value using the `.get` method.
```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    let name: &str =   
    names.get(0).unwrap();  
    println!("Hello, {}", name);  
}
```

We can borrow the value using the `.first()` or `.last()` method (if you want the first and last item, of course).
```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    let name: &str =   
    names.first().unwrap();  
    println!("Hello, {}", name);  
}
```

Butâ€¦ what if I want to _own_ an element?
We use the `.into_iter()` method to own the individual elements. More on iterators in the next chapter. Here, we manage to own the first element after calling `.next()`:
```rust
fn main() {  
    let names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    let mut names_iter =   
    names.into_iter();  
    let name: String =   
    names_iter.next().unwrap();  
    println!("Hello, {}", name);  
}
```

This example works if you want to own the first element. Afaik, if you want to own the element at index _n_ (for some reason), you would call `.skip(n)` then call `.next()`.

For `Vec`, we can `.pop()` the last element and own the data (only if you want the last element of a vector, of course).
```rust
fn main() {  
    let mut names = vec![  
       String::from("John"),  
       String::from("Jane"),  
   ];  
    let name: String = names.pop()  
    .unwrap();  
    println!("Hello, {}", name);  
}
```
